# FileOrg Virtual Environment

This file provides details on how to manage the 'FileOrg' Python virtual environment.

## Environment Name

The name of the virtual environment is **FileOrg**.

## Activating the Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command from the project root directory in your PowerShell terminal:

Your terminal prompt should change to show `(FileOrg)` at the beginning, indicating that the environment is active.

## Deactivating the Environment

deactivate
```

```

To install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To update the `requirements.txt` file after installing new packages, run:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
