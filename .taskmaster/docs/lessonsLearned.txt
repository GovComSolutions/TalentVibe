## Task 7: Display Results in Web UI - Name Extraction Issues

### Issue: Candidate Name Extraction Failing
**Problem**: The AI was not properly extracting candidate names from resumes, resulting in "Not provided" or "Unknown" values in the UI.

**Root Cause**: 
1. AI prompt was too strict and would return "Name Not Found" when uncertain
2. Backend fallback logic was not properly handling the AI's "Name Not Found" response
3. Database was storing literal "Name Not Found" strings instead of user-friendly fallbacks

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Improved AI Prompt**: Modified the prompt in `ai_service.py` to be more flexible:
   - Changed from strict "MUST return 'Name Not Found'" to "Make a best effort to find the name"
   - Added guidance for when to use "Name Not Found"

2. **Enhanced Backend Logic**: Updated `app.py` to handle edge cases:
   - Added explicit check for "Name Not Found" string from AI
   - Replace with user-friendly "Not Provided" before database storage
   - Improved fallback logic

3. **Database Consistency**: Ensured consistent naming across the application

### Key Lessons:

#### 1. AI Prompt Engineering
- **Lesson**: Be careful with overly strict AI prompts that can cause the AI to fail too easily
- **Best Practice**: Use "best effort" language rather than strict failure conditions
- **Action**: Always test AI prompts with various input types before deployment

#### 2. Error Handling Patterns
- **Lesson**: The same issue occurred twice, indicating a pattern in our development approach
- **Root Cause**: We tend to make AI prompts too rigid when trying to ensure consistent output
- **Best Practice**: Start with flexible prompts and add constraints only when necessary

#### 3. Database Design
- **Lesson**: Always consider what the user will see in the UI when designing database fallbacks
- **Best Practice**: Use user-friendly fallback values ("Not Provided") rather than technical ones ("Name Not Found")

#### 4. Testing Strategy
- **Lesson**: Name extraction issues are not immediately obvious in development
- **Best Practice**: Always test with real resume data that has various name formats
- **Action**: Create test cases with different name formats (first only, full name, initials, etc.)

### Technical Insights:

#### AI Service Integration
- **Pattern**: AI responses should be validated and sanitized before database storage
- **Implementation**: Always have a validation layer between AI output and database input

#### Frontend-Backend Communication
- **Lesson**: Real-time updates work well with WebSocket integration
- **Success**: The completion tracking system effectively notifies users when processing is done

### Future Recommendations:

1. **Create AI Response Validation Layer**: Implement a dedicated service to validate and sanitize AI responses
2. **Add Comprehensive Testing**: Create test suite for name extraction with various resume formats
3. **Document AI Prompt Patterns**: Maintain a library of effective AI prompts for different use cases
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Add logging to track AI response patterns and identify issues early

### Task Completion Notes:
- **Task 7**: Successfully completed with improved name extraction
- **Status**: All subtasks marked as done
- **Next**: Ready to proceed to Task 8 (Multi-Job & Multi-Tenant Support)
